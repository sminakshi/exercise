# web_frontend_project_1_FITNESS

This project was my first year project when I was learning HTML and CSS, and it was based on a fitness center in my local area. The project was designed to be fully mobile responsive, meaning that it can adapt and function effectively on a variety of mobile devices with different screen sizes and resolutions. Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to practice and improve my skills in HTML and CSS, as well as to learn about the principles of responsive web design.
