                <p>Aerobic exercises increase your heart rate and how much oxygen your body uses.
                When you practice aerobic exercise, your breathing controls the amount of oxygen that reaches your muscles to help you burn energy and move.
                Anaerobic means “without oxygen.” When you engage in a quick, high-intensity activity, your cells are not using oxygen to produce energy.
                Cycling is an aerobic exercise that you can do on a stationary bike or a regular bicycle.This activity helps your heart without putting too much mechanical stress on your back, hips, knees and ankles that walking can cause.</p>
